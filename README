Should fit on 48, 88, 168, and 328. I've tested TRICOPTER mode on an
ATmega88A. You may wish to use avrdude -t to "dump calibration" and
check timings on a digital scope. Temperature and voltage shift the
oscillator frequency a little, and each chip responds differently.
See doc8271.pdf page 401.

I notice a few microseconds of output jitter still with the internal
oscillator. It seems that only an external resonator or crystal will
solve this, but those pins are currently used for Rx and the LED, and
the Rx pin cannot be moved to another pin that does not share another
PCINT unless RESET is used for that purpose. If using all hardware
PPM, it may be acceptable to have a more expensive interrupt handler
that simply logs the interrupt time and pin states and do the rest of
the processing in RxGetChannels().

See http://www.kkmulticopter.com/

Hardware PPM supported on motor outputs M1, M2, M5 and M6; software
PPM on M3 and M4 (Rx interrupts can cause some jitter). M3 and M4
outputs will be copied to M5 and M6, when not otherwise used, to allow
use of full hardware PPM.
