Receiver / Transmitter settings:
    Remote control schematic diagram (with channel names):
          
       Collective (Throttle)       Pitch (Aileron)
                ↑                        ↑
               ←☼→ Yaw (Rudder)         ←☼→ Roll (Elevator)
                ↓                        ↓


                   
Run-time settings:
    1. Clear all settings.
        All settings will be cleared to their default values: 
            - Roll Gyro reversed
            - Pitch Gyro reversed
            - Rx offsets are zero
        Steps:    
            a) power off
            b) rotate all three potentiometers to minimal position (CCW)
            c) power on and and wait LED start blinking
            d) power off
            e) rotate all three potentiometers away from minimal position 
                (threshold is ~5%)
        
    2. Identify motors
        Don't know what it is. But it doesn't change any settings.
        Steps:
            a) power off
            b) rotate Pitch and Yaw potentiometers to minimal position (CCW)
            c) power on
            d) motors/servo will turn on sequentially (first to last) for a 
                short time.
            e) power off
            f) rotate all three potentiometers away from minimal position 
                (threshold is ~5%)
    3. Automatic receiver stick centering and utmost positions detection.
        Stick positions are read and saved in Non-Volatile memory (EEPROM) as 
        zero and utmost position offset.
        Steps:
            a) power off
            b) rotate Pitch and Roll potentiometers to minimal position (CCW)
            c) turn on transmitter, make sure all sticks except Throttle are
                in middle position and Throttle is on minimal
            c) power on and and wait LED start blinking
            d) move all sticks in all directions to theirs maximum positions
            e) return sticks to previous positions (tolerance is 5%) for three 
                seconds
            f) LED will start blinking slower
            g) power off
            h) rotate all three potentiometers away from minimal position 
                (threshold is ~5%)
    4. Gyros reverse.
        Steps:
            a) power off
            b) rotate Roll potentiometer to minimal position (CCW)
            .... this item lacks documentation ....
            d) power off
            e) rotate all three potentiometers away from minimal position 
                (threshold is ~5%)
    5. Motors Throttle calibration.
        Calibration is actually performed in ESC.
        Steps:
            a) power off
            b) rotate Yaw potentiometer to minimal position (CCW)
            c) turn on transmitter, set Throttle channel to it's maximum value
            d) power on
            e) wait ESC beeps (refer to ESC manual)
            f) set Throttle channel to it's maximum value
            g) wait ESC beeps (refer to ESC manual)
            h) power off
            i) rotate all three potentiometers away from minimal position 
                (threshold is ~5%)
